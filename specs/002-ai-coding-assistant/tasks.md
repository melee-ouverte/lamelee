**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí Extract: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: 6 entities (User, Experience, Prompt, Comment, Reaction, PromptRating)
   ‚Üí contracts/api.yaml: 8 endpoint groups
   ‚Üí research.md: Next.js full-stack decision
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: Next.js init, Prisma, NextAuth config
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: Prisma models, API routes, UI components
   ‚Üí Integration: GitHub OAuth, DB, middleware
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, quickstart validation
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different API routes = mark [P]
   ‚Üí Different Prisma models = mark [P]
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- Verify all tests fail (Red) before implementing (Green)
- NextAuth.js handles GitHub OAuth flow automatically
- Prisma generates TypeScript types from schema
- Use `npx prisma studio` to inspect database during development
- Run `npx prisma format` to format schema.prisma
- Connection pooling configured for 15+ concurrent connections minimum

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts** (api.yaml):
   - 10 contract test tasks (T006-T015) - one per endpoint group [P]
   - 11 API route implementation tasks (T031-T042) - grouped by file

2. **From Data Model** (data-model.md):
   - 6 model creation tasks (T024-T029) [P]
   - 1 migration task (T030)
   - Index creation (T059)
   - Soft delete (T060)

3. **From User Stories** (quickstart.md):
   - 8 integration tests (T016-T023) [P]
   - 5 page implementation tasks (T053-T057)

4. **Ordering**:
   - ‚úÖ Setup (T001-T005) ‚Üí Tests (T006-T023) ‚Üí Complete Implementation (T024-T060) 
   - ‚úÖ Integration & Enhancement (T061-T070) ‚Üí Testing & Quality (T071-T083)
   - üéØ **ALL PHASES COMPLETE**: Ready for Phase 4: Production Deployment

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 10 API endpoint groups have contract tests
- [x] All 6 entities have Prisma model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (except schema.prisma which is sequential)
- [x] All 8 user journey scenarios from quickstart.md have integration tests
