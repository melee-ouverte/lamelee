# Tasks: AI Coding Assistant Experience Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-ai-coding-assistant/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí Extract: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: 6 entities (User, Experience, Prompt, Comment, Reaction, PromptRating)
   ‚Üí contracts/api.yaml: 8 endpoint groups
   ‚Üí research.md: Next.js full-stack decision
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: Next.js init, Prisma, NextAuth config
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: Prisma models, API routes, UI components
   ‚Üí Integration: GitHub OAuth, DB, middleware
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, quickstart validation
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different API routes = mark [P]
   ‚Üí Different Prisma models = mark [P]
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Paths
- T001-T005 (Setup) ‚Üí Everything else
- T024-T030 (Models) ‚Üí T032-T042 (API Routes)
- T006-T023 (Tests) ‚Üí T024-T090 (All Implementation)
- T043-T046 (Libraries) ‚Üí T032-T042 (API Routes)
- T047-T048, T053-T054 (Core Components/Pages) ‚Üí Advanced Features
- T031 (Auth) ‚Üí All protected routes
- T068-T070 (DB Integration) ‚Üí Performance tests

### Blocking Dependencies (Completed)
- ‚úÖ T030 blocked T032-T042 (DB tables created before API routes)
- ‚úÖ T043 blocked T032-T042 (Prisma client created before queries)
- ‚úÖ T044-T046 blocked T032-T042 (validations and auth middleware created)
- ‚úÖ T047-T048 blocked T053-T054 (core components created before pages)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Round 1: Contract Tests (T006-T015)
```bash
# All contract tests can run in parallel - different test files
npm test tests/contract/experiences-get.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/experiences-post.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/experiences-id-get.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/experiences-id-put.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/experiences-id-delete.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/comments-post.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/reactions-post.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/ratings-post.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/users-me.test.ts &
npm test tests/contract/users-id.test.ts &
wait
```

### Round 2: Integration Tests (T016-T023)
```bash
# All integration tests can run in parallel - different test files
npm test tests/integration/auth.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/create-experience.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/feed-filter.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/community.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/user-profile.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/github-url-validation.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/prompt-rating.test.ts &
npm test tests/integration/data-retention.test.ts &
wait
```

### Round 3: Prisma Models (T024-T029)
```bash
# All models defined in same schema.prisma - CANNOT parallelize
# Must be done sequentially or all at once in single edit
```

### Round 4: Library Utilities (T043-T046) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Different files - parallelized successfully
# Created src/lib/db.ts (T043)
# Created src/lib/validations.ts (T044, T045)
# Updated src/lib/auth.ts (T046)
```

### Round 5: UI Components (T047-T048) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Core components created successfully
# Created src/components/ExperienceCard.tsx (T047)
# Created src/components/Layout.tsx (T048)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- Verify all tests fail (Red) before implementing (Green)
- NextAuth.js handles GitHub OAuth flow automatically
- Prisma generates TypeScript types from schema
- Use `npx prisma studio` to inspect database during development
- Run `npx prisma format` to format schema.prisma
- Connection pooling configured for 15+ concurrent connections minimum

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts** (api.yaml):
   - 10 contract test tasks (T006-T015) - one per endpoint group [P]
   - 11 API route implementation tasks (T031-T042) - grouped by file

2. **From Data Model** (data-model.md):
   - 6 model creation tasks (T024-T029) [P]
   - 1 migration task (T030)
   - Index creation (T059)
   - Soft delete (T060)

3. **From User Stories** (quickstart.md):
   - 8 integration tests (T016-T023) [P]
   - 5 page implementation tasks (T053-T057)

4. **Ordering**:
   - ‚úÖ Setup (T001-T005) ‚Üí Tests (T006-T023) ‚Üí Core Implementation (T024-T057) 
   - üöÄ Next: Advanced Features (T058-T067) ‚Üí Integration (T068-T077) ‚Üí Testing & Quality (T078-T090)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 10 API endpoint groups have contract tests
- [x] All 6 entities have Prisma model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (except schema.prisma which is sequential)
- [x] All 8 user journey scenarios from quickstart.md have integration tests
