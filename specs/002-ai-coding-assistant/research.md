# Research: AI Coding Assistant Experience Platform

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Full-Stack Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (Full-Stack)  
**Rationale**: 
- Single codebase for frontend and backend (API routes)
- Built-in GitHub OAuth with NextAuth.js
- TypeScript ensures type safety across entire stack
- Serverless deployment ready
- High performance with Edge Runtime support
**Alternatives considered**: FastAPI + React, Node.js/Express + React

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in GitHub OAuth integration with NextAuth.js
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- API routes can handle authentication flow
- TypeScript ensures type safety with API contracts
- File-based routing simplifies navigation
**Alternatives considered**: React 18, Vue.js, vanilla JavaScript

### Database
**Decision**: PostgreSQL 15  
**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for user data integrity
- JSON support for flexible prompt/experience content
- Full-text search capabilities for content discovery
- Proven scalability for community platforms
**Alternatives considered**: MongoDB, SQLite

### Authentication
**Decision**: NextAuth.js with GitHub Provider  
**Rationale**:
- Built into Next.js ecosystem
- GitHub OAuth provider included
- Session management handled automatically
- TypeScript support for auth types
- Secure JWT/database session storage

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library (Full-Stack)  
**Rationale**:
- Jest: Built into Next.js, tests both API routes and components
- React Testing Library: Component and page testing
- API route testing with Next.js test utilities
- Single testing framework for entire application
**Alternatives considered**: Vitest, Cypress, Playwright

### Deployment Platform
**Decision**: Docker containers on Linux  
**Rationale**:
- Containerization ensures consistent environments
- Easy scaling for concurrent connection requirements
- Standard deployment pattern for web applications
**Alternatives considered**: Serverless, bare metal

## Architecture Patterns

### API Design
**Decision**: Next.js API Routes with TypeScript  
**Rationale**:
- File-based API routing (/api/experiences, /api/prompts)
- TypeScript interfaces shared between frontend and API
- Built-in request/response handling
- Middleware support for authentication and validation

### Data Model Strategy
**Decision**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL  
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database access with TypeScript
- Automatic migrations and schema management
- Built-in connection pooling
- JSON field support for flexible content
- Generated client with IntelliSense support

### GitHub Integration
**Decision**: Server-side GitHub API validation  
**Rationale**:
- Validate GitHub URLs on backend before storage
- Cache GitHub repository metadata for preview
- Rate limiting protection for GitHub API calls
- Security: prevent malicious URL injection

## Performance Considerations

### Concurrent Connection Handling
**Decision**: Next.js with Serverless/Edge Runtime  
**Rationale**:
- Automatic scaling for concurrent requests
- Edge Runtime for global performance
- Built-in connection pooling
- Handles 15+ concurrent connections easily

### Database Optimization
**Decision**: Prisma with connection pooling  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in connection pooling via Prisma
- Optimized queries with Prisma's query engine
- Indexes defined in Prisma schema
- Pagination support with skip/take
- Query caching at application level

## Security Implementation

### Data Retention
**Decision**: Automated cleanup job with soft deletes  
**Rationale**:
- Soft delete preserves referential integrity
- Scheduled job removes data older than 2 years
- Audit trail for compliance requirements
- User data export before deletion

### Content Security
**Decision**: Input validation and GitHub URL verification  
**Rationale**:
- No content moderation per requirements
- Validate GitHub URLs against github.com domain
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

## Development Workflow

### Contract-First Development
**Decision**: OpenAPI schema drives development  
**Rationale**:
- Frontend and backend teams work in parallel
- Contract tests ensure API compatibility
- Automated client code generation
- Clear documentation for community contributors
