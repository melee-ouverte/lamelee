# Feature Specification: AI Coding Assistant Experience Platform

**Feature Branch**: `002-ai-coding-assistant`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to build a web application to log and share news and experiences on the use of AI coding assistants."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using AI coding assistants, I want to log my experiences and discoveries, share effective prompts and code examples with the community, and learn from others' experiences, prompt strategies, and actual code implementations to improve my own AI-assisted development workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I create a new experience entry with a prompt that worked well, **Then** the system saves my entry with the prompt and makes it visible to other users
2. **Given** I am browsing the community feed, **When** I filter by AI assistant type, **Then** I see only entries related to that specific assistant
3. **Given** I am viewing someone's experience with their prompt, **When** I want to try their approach, **Then** I can copy their prompt and access the linked code repository to see the implementation
4. **Given** I am searching for specific topics, **When** I use keywords like "debugging" or "refactoring", **Then** I see relevant experiences, prompts, and code examples from the community
5. **Given** I want to share breaking news about AI coding tools, **When** I create a news entry, **Then** other users can see and discuss the latest developments
6. **Given** I found an effective prompt for code review, **When** I log it as an experience with a link to my code, **Then** other users can discover the prompt and see the actual code it helped generate
7. **Given** I am sharing an experience about AI-generated refactoring, **When** I include URLs to before/after code versions, **Then** other users can see the concrete results of the AI assistance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to post inappropriate or spam content?
- How does the system handle very long experience descriptions or code snippets?
- What happens when a user deletes their account - are their contributions preserved or removed?
- How does the system handle duplicate experiences or news items?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
